Answers to Perl interview coding challenge questions.

Q1: Write a function which takes an array of characters, returns them in reverse order, with consonants lowercased and vowels uppercased.

Q2: Serialize, using a single calling syntax, an arbitrary data structure of hashes/arrays/scalars into either JSON or HTML (using the *ol* tag for arrays and *dl* for hashes). Given the answer was already abstracted, I provided an additional Perl serializer for good measure.
